NLog allows for a custom time source to be provided when timestamping log
entries. In addition, NLog provides a few default time sources that can easily
be configured via XML or code.

By default, NLog uses the FastLocalTimeSource as the default time source.

Note that the time source is used mostly for accuracy, so there might be some
quirks if using different time zones.

### Configure Via XML

The time source can be configured via XML by setting the time element with the
XML name. The provided time sources don’t include “TimeSource” in their XML
names.

```xml
<nlog>
    <time type="FastLocal" />
    <!-- Rest of Configuration -->
</nlog>
```

### Configure Via Runtime Configuration

The time source can be configured by inserting the following before any log
messages are printed:

```csharp
TimeSource.Current = new FastLocalTimeSource();
```

### Provided Time Sources

The provided time sources range from accurate to fast with options for a Local
or UTC time.

The accuracy relates directly to Windows and how it balances accuracy, speed,
and efficiency (i.e. battery life). By default, Windows is set to 16ms of
accuracy, but can be changed via the API calls of
[timeBeginPeriod](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd757624(v=vs.85).aspx>)
and
[timeEndPeriod](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd757626(v=vs.85).aspx>).
The AccurateLocal and AccurateUTC both utilize this API to provide a more
accurate time reading.

The speed relates directly to whether the time is UTC or local. When FastLocal
or AccurateLocal are used, they will be “slower” than their counterparts FastUTC
AccurateUTC because time zone conversions need to be applied to the local time
sources.

Below are the provided time sources with NLog:

| **XML Configuration** | **Is Default?** | **Runtime Configuration** | **Time** | **Accuracy** | **Speed** |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| FastLocal             | Yes             | FastLocalTimeSource       | local    | 16ms         | fastest   |
| FastUTC               | No              | FastUtcTimeSource         | UTC      | 16ms         | fastest   |
| AccurateLocal         | No              | AccurateLocalTimeSource   | local    | 1ms          | slow      |
| AccurateUTC           | No              | AccurateUtcTimeSource     | UTC      | 1ms          | fast      |

### Custom Time Source

Before implementing your own time source, see the provided time sources first.
If none of those fit your needs, this section will guide you through the
process.

Create a class that inherits from TimeSource and implement the inheritted
property getter `Time` and method `FromSystemTime`.

-   The property getter `Time` provides the current time instance.

-   The method FromSystemTime converts the system time to the same form as if
    the time source provided it.

```csharp
[TimeSource("CustomTimeZone")]
public class CustomTimeZoneTimeSource : TimeSource
{
    string ZoneName;
    TimeZoneInfo ZoneInfo;

    [Required]
    public string Zone
    {
        get { return ZoneName; }
        set
        {
            ZoneName = value;
            ZoneInfo
                = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(value);
        }
    }
    
    public override DateTime Time
    {
        get
        {
            return TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeFromUtc(
                DateTime.UtcNow, ZoneInfo);
        }
    }
    
    public override DateTime FromSystemTime(DateTime systemTime)
    {
        return TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeFromUtc(systemTime, ZoneInfo);
    }
}
```

In addition, add an attribute to the top that provides the name when specifying
the type via XML.

Your custom time source can be loaded by NLog just like any other NLog
extension. See [how to use the custom target / layout
renderer](<Extending%20NLog>).

The Runtime Configuration would look like this:

```csharp
TimeSource.Current = new CustomTimeZoneTimeSource()
{
    Zone = "Central Standard Time"
}
```

The XML Configuration would look like this:

```xml
<nlog>
    <time type="CustomTimeZone" zone="Central Standard Time" />
</nlog>
```
